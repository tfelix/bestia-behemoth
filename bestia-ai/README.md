# Bestia-AI

Flexible and customizable AI framework for long term planning game agents. 
It was developed to be used together on the server side of the Bestia game.

## About

Goal of this framework is to provide a framework for long term planning agents to simulate basically 
a normal daily routine. It must be flexible enough to support a range from hunting animals to settlers.

It is important to have the AI templates serializable, so they can be saved or configured and then 
loaded by the agents during runtime.

> Currently, this framework is in an experimental stage and broken and non-working builds will be the norm.
