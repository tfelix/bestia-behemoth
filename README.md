# Bestia Behemoth - MMORPG Server & Client

[![Awesome Kotlin Badge](https://kotlin.link/awesome-kotlin.svg)](https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin)

> **Forge your destiny in a world reborn from chaos.** An open-source fantasy MMORPG where emergent gameplay meets innovative game design, built with Kotlin and Godot.

## 🌍 Welcome to a World Torn Apart

In the aftermath of the **Rift** - a cataclysmic event that merged realities and unleashed uncontrolled magic - survivors emerge into a harsh new world. **Bestia** is more than just another MMORPG; it's a living, breathing ecosystem where your choices will ripple across vast procedurally generated landscapes spanning thousands of square kilometers. Inspired by [Ragnarök Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online) and [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon).

This monorepo contains the complete technical foundation for the Bestia universe:

- **High-performance server backend** engineered in Kotlin together with Spring Boot
- **Open source game client** powered by the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org)
- **Scalable architecture** will support thousands of concurrent players and entities

## 🎮 Game Philosophy

**Bestia** embraces emergent gameplay where player actions shape the world's destiny. Choose your path:

- **Builders** who reconstruct civilization from the ruins
- **Adventurers** exploring dangerous, magic-warped territories
- **Survivors** forging alliances in a world where cooperation means survival
- **Faction Leaders** determining whether to hasten the world's transformation or preserve what remains

The game world evolves dynamically based on collective player decisions, creating unique experiences that can't be found anywhere else.
