# Bestia Browsergame Client

This is the client implementation of the [Bestia Browsergame](https://bestia-game.net).

Currently its meant as a development platform and as an introduction game, thus no connection to the server is established and is solely a single user game.

Later it will use the server and create an innovative 2D MMORPG.

## Development

In order to build and run the client just do:

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

inside the main folder.
