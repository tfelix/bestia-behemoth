# Project Overview

This project is an open source MMORPG that presents a huge 3D voxel based game world with lots of interactions.
It uses Spring, Kotlin, Protobuf and MariaDB as the server backend (and focuses on open source technologies). The client
uses the Godot game engine with GDScript, C++ and C#.

## Folder Structure

This is a multi-module gradle project. The Gradle specific files are under the root `/` like `./gradlew.bat` and `./gradlew` .

- `/login-server`: Contains the source code for the login server responsible for user login and authentication logic via JWT.
- `/zone-server`: Contains the source code for the main backend server which manages game state, game logic and network sync.
- `/cli-client`: Contains the source code for a text based, cli client to connect to the server for testing purposes.
into in-game data .
- `/bestia-client`: Contains the Godot engine client code for connecting to the server and playing the game.
- `/bestia-client/src/Bnet/Proto`: Contains the autogenerated protobuf files from the `./gen-protobuf.bat` script. DO NOT TOUCH.
- `/bestia-client/src/Bnet/Message`: Contains the interface messages between Godot engine and the protobuf envelopes. Matching 
and Godot engine compatible C# files are put in there.
- `/bestia-client/raw-assets`: Contains the raw data like images, textures and models in their raw form, before they are converted to be used with Godot.
- `/bnet-messages`: Contains protobuf files which describe the message format.
- `/shared`: Is a Gradle module which contains shared code, usually between `login-server` and `zone-server`

# Unit Tests

Follow those guidelines when creating unit tests:

When creating names for the methods make use of Kotlin option for space in names via backticks \`. Use the following 
pattern: <NAME_OF_METHOD> <SHORT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS TESTED> <EXPECTED OUTPUT>. Example: 'doLogin with an invalid 
login throws LoginException'.

Do not @autowire the constructor but use `lateinit var` instead.

**DON'T DO THIS**

```kotlin
@Autowired constructor(
  val restTemplate: TestRestTemplate,
): LoginScenario()
```

**DO THIS**

```kotlin
@Autowired
private lateinit var restTemplate: TestRestTemplate
```

When told to create a test/unit test, do not create a Spring Boot test. Just a regular Junit test. When told to create a
scenario (or explicit a Spring Boot test) create a Spring Boot based test. Check if there is a parent class which you are
supposed to extend for such a test.

For mocking use mockk and extend the Junit 5 classes with `@ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class)`

The object which is tested inside a test should be kept in a class property name `sut` (service under test).

# Extending the Message Protocol

* Messages send FROM the client TO the server are postfixed with `CMSG` (client message).
* Messages send FROM the server TO the client are postfiex with `SMSG` (server message).

The workflow to add or modify a message goes like this:

* Adapt the protobuf sources inside `/bnet-messages` according to the requirement.
* Generate the C# files via `./gen-protobuf.bat`
* Add the interaction and Godot API friendly layer in `/bestia-client/src/Bnet/Message`
* Add the messages in the zone server backend. The messages there are placed in a domain sorted module structure where it makes most sense. But also here they must inherit from their respective `SMSG` or `CMSG` interfaces.
* Please note that depending on the interface some implementations must have helper methods which will produce a Bnet (this means the protobuf envelope) message when getting called. This must be implemented too.
* On the server side you also must also add a handler which derived from `InMessageProcessor.IncomingMessageHandler<T>`. You can leave the body out and just add a `TODO()`.
* On the server side you also must adapt the `BnetMessageProcessorAdapter` which will convert from the Bnet protobuf message into a server internal message format.
* For components there are some special patterns. Inside the `envelope.proto` they look like this: `BestiaVisualComponentSMSG comp_bestia_visual`. They start with `comp_` but do NOT end with `_component`.
* Properties inside the envelope don't have the SMSG or CMSG postfix.

# Project Specific Instructions

## zone-server

1. When adding a new exception always extend from `BestiaException` and assign a specific error code.

# Running Tests

The game is developed on different operating systems. When executing commands in the shell DO NOT use platform
specifics like the '&&' to combine to commands. This will not work on windows developer machines.
